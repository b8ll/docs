## Cooldown System

After generating an account, you must wait before generating another account of the same type. Cooldowns are per-account-type, so you can generate different types simultaneously.

## Cooldown Durations

### Ultra Tier

| Account Type | Cooldown |
|--------------|----------|
| alt | 10 seconds |
| +30 days old | 30 seconds |
| +1 year old | 2 minutes |
| 5+ years old | 5 minutes |
| dump | 10 minutes |
| dump (unchecked) | 10 seconds |

### Premium Tier

| Account Type | Cooldown |
|--------------|----------|
| alt | 30 seconds |
| +30 days old | 1 minute |
| +1 year old | 5 minutes |
| 5+ years old | 10 minutes |
| dump | 30 minutes |
| dump (unchecked) | 30 seconds |

### Free Tier

| Account Type | Cooldown |
|--------------|----------|
| alt | 2 hours |
| +30 days old | 6 hours |
| +1 year old | 12 hours |
| 5+ years old | 24 hours |
| dump | 48 hours |
| dump (unchecked) | 24 hours |

### Resell

No cooldowns apply.

## Daily Limits

| Role | Daily Limit |
|------|-------------|
| Free | 100 accounts |
| Premium | 100 accounts |
| Ultra | 100 accounts |
| Resell | Unlimited |

Daily limits reset at midnight UTC.

## Handling Cooldowns

When a cooldown is active, the API returns HTTP 429 with the remaining time:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Cooldown active",
  "timeRemaining": 25000
}
```

The `timeRemaining` field is in milliseconds. Use this to implement retry logic:

```javascript
async function generateWithRetry(apiKey, type) {
  const response = await fetch("/api/generate", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ apiKey, type })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  
  if (response.status === 429 && data.timeRemaining) {
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, data.timeRemaining));
    return generateWithRetry(apiKey, type);
  }
  
  return data;
}
```

## Daily Limit Response

When the daily limit is exceeded:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Daily limit exceeded (100 accounts)"
}
```

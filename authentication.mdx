All API requests require authentication using your API key.

## API Key Format

API keys follow the format:

```
BLOX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Where `X` is an uppercase letter (A-Z) or digit (0-9). The key is exactly 21 characters long.

## Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to your [BloxGen Dashboard](https://bloxgen.net/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API**
3. Click **Generate API Key** or copy your existing key

<Warning>
Keep your API key secret. Anyone with your key can generate accounts and spend your balance.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the request body:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "BLOX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "type": "alt"
}
```

## Requirements

Your account must meet these requirements to use the API:

- Email verified
- Account not banned or suspended
- Sufficient balance for the requested account type
